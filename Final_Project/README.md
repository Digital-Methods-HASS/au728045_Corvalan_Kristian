## About our project
In this project, we examine how the Austro-Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt was received in Danish media when he came to Denmark in 1841.
By using text mining in R Studio we have been looking at the words that were used to describe Franz Liszt and in which context they appeared alongside with a sentiment analysis that assesses the emotion of the words and sentences.
